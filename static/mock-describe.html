  <div class="description">The OODA loop is a cycle of four steps: observe, orient, decide, and act. It is used as a
    lens for strategic thinking and can be applied in both confrontational and non-confrontational contexts. In the
    context of a game with two players, it can be seen as two interrelated loops, with each player observing and
    orienting based on the other's actions. At the core of the OODA loop is the concept of a model, which is used to
    create an action between two ticks of the environment's clock and to update the model of the environment to keep it
    accurate. It also serves as a tool for teams to steer the environment into a desired state. In some cases, an inner
    OODA loop may operate within individuals, focusing its intention on meeting the demands of the expectation gradient.
